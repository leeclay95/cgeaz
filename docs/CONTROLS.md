# Control Mappings

Every policy, collector, report and gate rule in this repository, mapped to the controls it serves.
This file is what turns the repository from code into a control catalogue, and it is a first-class
criterion on the capstone rubric.

- **NIST CSF 2.0** is the crosswalk the rubric grades: one category per row.
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** identifiers are the controls a component implements or supports. They
  are my mapping of each component's behaviour to the control's intent, not a claim that a single
  component satisfies a control on its own. Titles are in the legend at the end.

Marked **(added)** are components I built or changed on top of the starter; the rest shipped with it.
Only components that exist in the code appear here.

## Stage 01: Foundation

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Management group hierarchy + `cge-grc-baseline` initiative assignment | Controls inherit to every current and future subscription: compliance by design | CM-2, CM-6 | GV.PO, GV.OC |
| `cge-require-env-tag-rg` (Audit) | Inventory hygiene; ownership accountability feeds the POA&M | CM-8 | ID.AM |
| `cge-deny-public-blob` (Deny) | Prevents public blob exposure at the API, before the resource exists | AC-3, AC-4, SC-7 | PR.DS |
| `cge-dine-storage-diagnostics` (DeployIfNotExists) | Logging that enforces its own coverage | AU-2, AU-12 | PR.PS, DE.CM |
| Remediation identity (user-assigned, whitelisted roles) | Every automated change has a named, auditable author | AC-2, AC-6 | PR.AA, GV.RR |
| Log Analytics workspace + Activity Log routing | Central audit trail beyond the 90-day default | AU-2, AU-3, AU-12 | DE.CM, PR.PS |
| Activity-log tripwire: scheduled KQL alert + email action group (added) | Hourly check for any administrative write or delete by a caller other than the remediation identity; each hit is matched to a merged pull request, an unmatched one is out-of-band change. Detection only, changes nothing | AU-6, CM-3, CM-5, SI-4 | DE.CM-01, DE.AE-02 |

## Stage 02: Activation

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defender plan baseline (discovery-first) | Reads every plan's tier, reports the gap, converges the baseline; plans outside it are never touched | CA-7, RA-5 | ID.RA, DE.CM |
| NIST CSF 2.0 initiative assignment | Maps Defender's continuous assessments to framework controls without re-testing | CA-2, CA-7 | GV.OV, ID.IM |

## Stage 03: Evidence Store

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cosmos DB (assessments / frameworks / mappings) | Owned evidence schema; collect once, crosswalk to every framework | CA-2, AU-9 | GV.OV, ID.RA |
| WORM immutability policy on `reports` | Artifacts tamper-proof by platform guarantee; a delete fails for every identity | AU-9, AU-11, SI-7 | PR.DS |
| Shared keys disabled + data-plane RBAC (evidence account, and the Terraform state account) | Identity or nothing; no credentials to steal or rotate | IA-5, AC-3, AC-6 | PR.AA |
| Collector Function (Security Reader + Cosmos write only) | Continuous control-test capture with lineage; cannot alter what it observes | CA-7, AC-6 | DE.CM, ID.RA |
| Per-run document IDs: `sha256(assessment, resource, runId)` (added, tested) | A retried write of one sweep upserts the same document; the next sweep writes new ones, so no sweep overwrites another and any past run stays queryable | AU-3, AU-11, SI-7 | PR.DS, DE.AE |
| `runs` ledger container (added, tested) | One entry per sweep: when, how it started (timer or manual), documents written, findings by severity. Written last, so an entry means the run is complete; reports pin to it | AU-2, AU-3, AU-12 | DE.CM, PR.PS |
| Crosswalk seeded as data: `mappings` (added) | 41 Defender assessments mapped to 800-53 Rev.5 controls and CSF 2.0 subcategories (82 documents). A framework is rows in a container, never a second collection | CA-2, PM-9 | GV.OV, ID.RA |
| Application Insights for both Function Apps, workspace-based (added) | A failed timer run leaves an exception trail in Log Analytics | AU-2, AU-6, SI-4 | DE.CM |
| Transport and recovery hygiene (added) | Function Apps `https_only`; 7-day blob soft delete and 1-day SAS expiry on the storage accounts | SC-8, CP-9, AC-3 | PR.DS |
| Severity via `$expand=metadata` (added) | Stores each finding's severity so reports can rank and date it | CA-5, RA-5 | ID.RA |
| Owner stamping (added) | Every finding carries an accountable owner: the resource group's tag, else visibly unassigned, else the platform owner for subscription-level findings | CM-8(4), CA-5 | ID.AM, GV.RR |
| Collector / reporter identity split | The recorder of facts cannot author the narrative: SoD by role scopes | AC-5, AC-6 | PR.AA, GV.RR |

## Stage 04: Reporting

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| POA&M generator (SLA-dated) | Weakness management with owners, dates and the 800-53 and CSF controls each finding evidences (crosswalk read from the store); findings ranked by severity with stable IDs. Cut from one recorded run and named after it (`poam-YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMZ`), so one run yields one immutable file and a repeat call is a no-op (added) | CA-5, PM-4 | ID.IM, GV.RM |
| SAR generator | Assessment reporting where every number traces to a stored document; shows severity and owner. Same run-named, write-once files (added) | CA-2 | ID.RA, GV.OV |
| Schedules (compressed for this build) | Collector at :00, POA&M at :10 and SAR at :20 every hour: the cadence a production build spreads over a day and a week, run over hours | CA-7 | DE.CM |
| Store-only reporting (guarded by a unit test) | No report generator references a live platform API, so any number is reproducible by a stored query | AU-7 | ID.RA, GV.OV |
| Reporter identity (Cosmos read + Blob write only) | Cannot write evidence, cannot read Defender | AC-5, AC-6 | PR.AA, GV.RR |

## Stage 06: Enforcement

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cge-fix-public-blob` (Modify, mode ladder) | Auto-remediation through the dedicated identity; human-approved in dry-run | CM-6, AC-3 | PR.DS, RS.MI |
| `remediation_mode` variable | Escalation is a reviewed diff: automation acts, humans authorize | CM-3 | GV.PO, GV.RR |

## Repository gates and operations

| Component | What it does | 800-53 Rev. 5 | CSF 2.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `policy/storage.rego` | Pipeline storage below the pipeline's own standard (public blob, shared keys) is unmergeable | CM-3, AC-3, IA-5 | PR.DS |
| `policy/policy_identity.rego` | Blocks a policy assignment with no identity block, which would apply cleanly and never remediate. Counts identity entries, because a plan renders an absent block as an empty list (fixed, added) | SI-2, CM-3 | PR.PS |
| `policy/tls.rego` (added) | Storage must keep TLS 1.2 and HTTPS-only transfer; function apps must be `https_only` | SC-8, SC-13 | PR.DS-02 |
| `policy/cosmos_identity.rego` (added) | Cosmos DB key authentication must stay disabled | IA-2, IA-5 | PR.AA-01 |
| `policy/test-examples.sh` + `policy/examples/` (added) | Proves the rules fire: the compliant plan passes and the insecure plan is rejected once per rule (8 violations) | SA-11, CM-3 | PR.PS |
| `static-checks` workflow (added) | `terraform fmt` and `validate` and `tflint` per stage, checkov with a documented skip list (`.checkov.yaml`), the gate-rule examples, and gitleaks. No cloud credentials | SA-11, SA-15, IA-5 | PR.PS, ID.IM |
| `policy/broad_roles.rego` | Owner/Contributor grants in governance code are unmergeable | CM-3, AC-6 | PR.AA |
| `compliance-gate` workflow (hardened, added) | Terraform validate + plan for four stages, then a pinned, checksum-verified conftest; required on `main` | CM-3, CM-4 | ID.IM, PR.PS |
| Branch protection on `main` | Four required gate checks; force pushes disabled | CM-3, CM-5 | PR.PS |
| `drift-detection` workflow (rewritten) | Scheduled `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` per stage; the exit code is captured without a pipe so drift cannot be lost. Drift opens one GitHub issue per stage with the diff, later runs comment on it, and a clean plan closes it. A plan that errors turns the job red | CM-2, CM-3, CM-6, CA-7 | DE.CM |
| Terraform state account (added) | Shared keys off, blob versioning and 7-day soft delete, `CanNotDelete` lock, provider `subscription_id` explicit in every stage | AC-3, CP-9, CM-3 | PR.DS, PR.PS |
| `scripts/poam_history.py` (added) | Read-only operator view of every POA&M produced: creation time, timer or manual origin from the run ledger, and whether each report's count equals the store's count for its run | AU-6, CA-7 | DE.CM, ID.IM |
| `unit-tests` workflow and `tests/` (added) | 32 tests on the evidence path and the operator tools (per-run IDs, ledger, owner stamping, severity order, crosswalk, store-only reporting), run on pull requests and nightly | SA-11 | PR.PS |
| `guide-ci` workflow | Every code block and relative link in the guides is machine-checked | SA-11 | PR.PS |

## Blast radius and rollback

What each enforcement change would break, and how to undo it.

| Policy | What changes | What could break | Rollback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cge-deny-public-blob` (Deny) | Creating or updating a storage account with public blob access is rejected at the API. Existing public accounts are not changed by a Deny. | Anything relying on anonymous blob access, such as static-site hosting. Infrastructure code that sets `allow_nested_items_to_be_public = true` fails to apply. | Set `public_blob_policy_effect` to `Audit` through a reviewed change; it takes effect within minutes. |
| `cge-require-env-tag-rg` (Audit) | Nothing is blocked; resource groups without an `env` tag are marked non-compliant. | Nothing operational; it adds compliance noise. | Set `tag_policy_effect` to `Disabled`. |
| `cge-dine-storage-diagnostics` (DeployIfNotExists) | Deploys a diagnostic setting on storage accounts, routing to the GRC workspace. | Adds log ingestion cost. Needs the remediation identity's Monitoring Contributor role. | Remove the assignment; diagnostic settings already deployed remain and must be deleted separately. |
| `cge-fix-public-blob` (Modify, dry-run) | Sets `allowBlobPublicAccess` to `false` on non-compliant storage accounts under `mg-grc-sandbox`. In dry-run nothing changes until a person creates a remediation task. It cannot delete resources or read data. | Anything that needs anonymous blob access to an existing account. | Set `remediation_mode` to `audit` and merge; in-flight tasks fail closed. |
| Activity-log tripwire | An email when someone other than the remediation identity writes or deletes a resource. Creates no resource other than the alert and its action group | Alert noise from every deploy by a person, by design | Delete `tripwire.tf`; detection is lost, enforcement is not |
| Remediation identity roles | Monitoring Contributor (stage 01) and Storage Account Contributor (stage 06), both at `mg-grc-sandbox`. | The Storage Account Contributor built-in role can also list and regenerate account keys; a custom role limited to writing storage accounts would be narrower. | Remove the role assignment. |
